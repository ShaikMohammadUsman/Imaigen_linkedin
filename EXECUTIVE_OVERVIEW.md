- **Capacity**: Can scan up to **500 candidates per day** (50 search pages).
- **Intelligence**: uses "Smart Fallback" technology to handle LinkedIn's ever-changing layout.

### 2. **Deep Enrichment**
- **What it does**: Visits each candidate's profile to extract work history, skills, education, and contact info.
- **Value**: Builds a rich internal database of talent that you own forever.
- **Output**: Detailed CSV reports with normalized data suitable for ATS import.

### 3. **Smart Outreach**
- **What it does**: Sends personalized connection invites and follow-up messages.

- **Reply Tracking**: Automatically detects when a candidate replies and notifies the team.

### 4. **Safety First (Anti-Ban Technology)**
- **Human-Like Behavior**: 
  - Randomizes delays (e.g., waits 3.2s, then 5.8s, then 7.4s) just like a human.
  - Scrolls pages naturally before clicking.

## 🛡️ Safety & Compliance Limits

To ensure long-term account health, the system enforces the following **Daily Safety Limits**:

| Action | Daily Limit | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Harvesting** | **50 Search Pages** (~500 profiles) | Prevents "Commercial Use Limit" blocks. |
| **Enrichment** | **20 Profiles** (Configurable) | Mimics a highly active but human recruiter. |
| **Outreach** | **20 New Connections** | Avoids flagging for spam/automation. |

*Note: These limits can be adjusted in the configuration but are set conservatively by default.*

## 🔄 End-to-End Workflow

1. **Source**: Recruiter inputs a LinkedIn search URL (e.g., "Backend Developers in Bangalore").
2. **Harvest**: Bot scans 50 pages and saves 500+ profile URLs to the "Pool".
3. **Select**: Recruiter selects the top 20 candidates from the Pool.
4. **Engage**: Bot visits each profile, extracts data, and sends a personalized invite.
5. **Track**: System checks for replies every 30 minutes and updates the dashboard.
